Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate at university of california, Irvine. I am currently doing
research under Prof. [Ray Luo](http://rayluolab.org/principal-investigator/). 


I am a new research in computational biology and focus on revealing the microscopic behaviour of 
bio-molecules with computer simulations. I am interested in developing new methods in molecular dynamics
simulation, as well as its application in bio-science.


My current research focuses on enhanced sampling and free energy calculation
